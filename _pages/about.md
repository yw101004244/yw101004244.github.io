Hi there, welcome! I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. It's a great fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yong Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/liuyong). I previously earned my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in June 2022.

I am interested in responsible AI and trustworthy AI, particularly focusing on fairness and robustness:
- **Fairness**. Formulating intuitive and rigorous solutions to reduce AI discrimination.
- **Robustness**. Developing powerful and solid attack and defense algorithms for AI.

Currently, I am also interested in **AI alignment** and aim to bridge the research gap between responsible AI and AI alignment.
