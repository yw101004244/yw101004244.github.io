Hi, everyone! I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. It's a great fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yong Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/liuyong). 

I'm interested in trustworthy AI (especially fairness and robustness). I'm particularly excited about the fundamental understanding of some interesting problems! Welcome to cooperation and discussion.
