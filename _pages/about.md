Hi, everyone! I'm a second-year PhD student in Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. It's a great fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yong Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/liuyong). I'm interested in trustworthy AI (especially fairness and robustness) and AI alignment. 

Welcome to cooperation and discussion! I am willing to participate in and contribute to research! I'm particularly excited about the fundamental understanding of some interesting problems! Feel free to contact me!
