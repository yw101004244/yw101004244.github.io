Hi there, welcome! I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. I am truly honored to be advised by **[Prof. Yong Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/liuyong)**. Starting late this year, I will be a visiting student at the National University of Singapore, collaborating with **[Prof. Yunbei Xu](https://yunbeixu.github.io/)**.

From October 2023 to March 2024, as a research intern at Shanghai AI Laboratory, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of **[Prof. Jing Shao](https://amandajshao.github.io/)**. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in June 2022. Iâ€™m very fortunate to be advised by **[Prof. Kun He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YTQnGJsAAAAJ&hl=en)**. During my undergraduate studies, I was honored to receive the **National Scholarship (2019)**, a recognition that motivated me to pursue further research in AI.

# Research Interests
---

My previous research focused on trustworthy AI, including fairness, robustness and interpretability: [ICML25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06851), [TMLR24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=iBgmoMTlaz), [ACL24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.290.pdf), [CVPR23](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Tang_Fair_Scratch_Tickets_Finding_Fair_Sparse_Networks_Without_Weight_Training_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf).

I'm currently focused on superalignment, particularly the area of weak-to-strong generalization, as demonstrated by our work in [ACL25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11107) and several upcoming preprints.
